# 🖼️ Image Resizer GUI

A simple yet powerful **batch image resizer with a graphical interface**, built in Python using **Tkinter** and **Pillow (PIL)**.  
Designed to quickly resize, convert, and save multiple images at once — ideal for **social media, e-commerce, photography, and freelancing gigs**.

## ✨ Features

- **Batch support** → select multiple files or entire folders  
- **Two resize modes**:
  - By percentage (e.g., 50% smaller)  
  - By exact dimensions (width × height, with optional aspect-ratio lock)  
- **Supported formats**: JPG, PNG, WEBP, BMP, TIFF  
- **Format conversion** → convert images to JPG, PNG, or WEBP  
- **JPEG quality control** with adjustable slider (50–100)  
- **Safe saving** → preserves originals, appends `_resized` or auto-increments file names  
- **Preview mode** → check resized dimensions before processing  
- **Progress bar + status log** for large batches
